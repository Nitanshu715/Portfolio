## 👤 About Me

I'm a 3rd-year BTech CSE student with a specialization in Cloud Computing. My learning approach blends core computer science with real-world dev tools like AWS, Git, and frontend frameworks. I love building things — whether it's a budget tracker or a CLI cloud utility.

I believe in real skills, which can only be gained through practice and learning, rather than hype.
